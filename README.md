## Overview

This is a template application for developers interested in building Go web applications with:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models integration
- Document search capabilities using both full-text search (BM25) and vector search (embeddings)
- A flexible architecture supporting RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and tool use

Key features:
- Local database (SQLite) for document storage and retrieval
- Local LLM support (Llama 3) for text generation
- Local embeddings model (mxbai-embed-large-v1) for vector generation
- Document CRUD endpoints with automatic chunking
- Simple and extensible Go architecture

## Roadmap

- [x] Local SQLite database with full-text search (FTS5)
- [x] Local LLM integration (Llama 3)
- [x] Local embeddings model (mxbai-embed-large-v1)
- [x] Document CRUD API with automatic chunking
- [x] Vector search implementation
- [ ] Prompt endpoint with LLM tool use capabilities
- [ ] RAG implementation for improved LLM responses
- [ ] Advanced chunking strategies
- [ ] Multi-model support
